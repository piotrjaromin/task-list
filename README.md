TODO / TASK list application
---


Frontend and backend are separated.

- backend is written in nodejs and uses mongodb as backing database.
- frontend is written in reactjs.


Application can be run on local host by calling "npm start" in each directory(although NODE_ENV change is needed for frontend in webpack.config.js).

Docker-compose can also be used from this root directory just call:

```bash
    start-compose.sh
```
